# bank-loan-prediction
This project uses linear regression to predict whether a bank customer will repay a loan or not, based on features such as income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The goal is to build a simple yet interpretable model that can assist banks in making data-driven lending decisions.
# 🏦 Bank Loan Prediction using Linear Regression

This project uses **linear regression** to predict whether a customer is likely to repay a bank loan based on features such as income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The goal is to build a simple, interpretable model that can support financial institutions in making better loan approval decisions.
